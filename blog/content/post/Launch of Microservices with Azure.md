It has been months since my friend [Namit](http://namit.me) and I have been working on bringing to life a comprehensive book on Microservices applications specifically targeted for deployment in the cloud. We realized how the community is too keen to get started with Microservices, but there is so little guidance available on the subject. We studied several real-world implementations and documented the learnings as a set of patterns that help solve some of the most common challenges architects face while designing Microservices applications.

The result of the effort that we put in is our first title: **Microservices with Azure**.
